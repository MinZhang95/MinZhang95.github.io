I received my Bachelor's Degree in Statistics from [Shanghai University of Finance and Economics](http://english.sufe.edu.cn/). My research interests include Statistical Modeling, Bayesian Analysis, Applied Statistics in Veterinary Medicine, Deep Machine Learning. 

I have been working as a Research Assistant since 2016. My job is to build statistical models and develop algorithms to solve problems from Education and Veterinary Science.
